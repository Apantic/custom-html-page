# Custom HTML Page

An add-on for XenForo to give you 1 custom HTML page to use. It is used at https://www.apantic.com for a homepage.

To set up the page, use the template acomhomepage_layout to set up the html head and layout. Be aware of certain variables in there; do not remove variable configurations (such as $title, $contents). Use the template acomhomepage and acomhomepage.css to setup the page body.

The phrase acomhomepage is used to determine what users are shown as viewing when viewing this page.
